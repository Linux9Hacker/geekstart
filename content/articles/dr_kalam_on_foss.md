Summary: The People's president wanted everyone to embrace open source


"In India, open source code software will have to come and stay *in a big way* for the benefit of our billion people."

- ** Dr.A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, President of India, May 28, 2003**

Though it may not be a well known fact, the people's president was an avid supporter of open source software and was quite often seen upholding its use over proprietary software. An underlying reason being that he wanted the security of his country to be in safe hands and not at someone else's mercy as is the case with many proprietary systems.

He advocated the application of the *Open Source Philosophy* (1) in the following fields

 - eGovernance
 - The Justice delivery system
 - Health care
 - Agriculture
 - Safe Drinking Water

"The most unfortunate thing" he had said in a speech at IIIT Pune, "is that India still seems to believe in proprietary solutions".
He also recounted an incident (2) in which he discussed Open Source with Bill Gates, but it turned into a difficult discussion due to their differing views on [FOSS][1].
